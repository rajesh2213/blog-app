# Step 1: Decide on Your Repository Structure
Monorepo (recommended for easier local development): Create a single repo with subdirectories:

/client (React app for public site)

/admin (React app for admin dashboard)

/server (Express + Prisma API backend)

OR

Multiple repos: Create separate GitHub repos for each (client, admin, server) and treat them as independent apps.

# Step 2: Design Your Database Models and Schema
Use an ERD or notes to design the database. Use Prisma to implement later.

User

id, username, email, passwordHash, role (admin/user), createdAt

Post

id, title, content, authorId (FK to User), published (boolean), createdAt, updatedAt

Comment

id, content, postId (FK), userId (FK or null for anonymous), createdAt

Design decisions to make:

Will comments require login or just a name/email?

Will you allow draft (unpublished) posts?

Will comments have their own titles? (Usually no)

Will users be able to edit/delete their own comments?

# Step 3: Set Up the Express + Prisma Backend
Initialize a Node.js + Express app in /server

Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local dev)

Define your models in schema.prisma and run migrations

Seed the database with a default admin user

# Step 4: Build Routes and Controllers
Organize your API RESTfully:

Posts

GET /posts, GET /posts/:id, POST /posts, PUT /posts/:id, DELETE /posts/:id

Use query parameters for filtering (e.g., ?published=true)

Comments

POST /posts/:id/comments, DELETE /comments/:id

Users

POST /register, POST /login, GET /me (for profile), etc.

Use JWT middleware to protect sensitive routes

# Step 5: Implement JWT Authentication
Use jsonwebtoken for issuing and verifying tokens

Login route returns a JWT (store it in localStorage on the client)

Protect routes like POST /posts using middleware that verifies JWT

Optional: use Passport with JWT strategy if you're familiar with Passport

# Step 6: Test Your API
Use Postman, curl, or any REST client to test:

Registration, login, protected routes

Creating, editing, deleting posts/comments

# Step 7: Build the Public React Frontend (/client)
Fetch posts via API and display them

Display post details with comments

Add form to submit new comments

Store JWT in localStorage after login (if login required for comments)

# Step 8: Build the Admin React Frontend (/admin)
Authenticate admin via login form

Display list of posts with publish status

Add forms to:

Create/edit posts

Publish/unpublish

Manage (edit/delete) comments

# Step 9: Deploy All Apps
Backend: Deploy using Render, Railway, Fly.io, or any PaaS

Frontend apps: Deploy on Netlify, Vercel, or Surge (one for /client, another for /admin)

Ensure CORS and environment variables are configured correctly

Optional Enhancements (After MVP)
Add rich text support with TinyMCE or Quill

Add image uploads via Cloudinary

Add pagination, search, or filtering

Add user roles and permissions
